# Installing Windows 10 Education v1703 on Linux Mint 18.2

Most students know [Huskertech](http://sales.unl.edu/software) sells Windows 10 for $25. But lesser known is that students enrolled in [programs](http://cba.unl.edu/academic-programs/programs-and-degrees/) associated with the College of Business, such as:

* Accounting
* Actuarial Science
* Agribusiness
* Business Administration
* Economics
* Finance
* International Business
* Management
* Marketing
* Supply Chain Management

have access to a variety of **free** software from [Microsoft Imagine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Imagine) (formerly **DreamSpark**) including Windows 10. All graciously provided by [Student IT Resources](http://cba.unl.edu/people/itservices/msdnaa/login/cba-iuv.aspx) and a sprinkle of student fees :)

The Microsoft Imagine access portal (requires `My.UNL credentials`) can be found here:
